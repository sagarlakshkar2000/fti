RewriteEngine On

# 1. If the request is already for the /public folder, stop here
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/public/
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

# 2. Redirect everything else to the /public folder
# This keeps your URL clean (e.g., example.com/login instead of example.com/public/login)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]

# 3. (Optional) If your public folder has its own index.php,
# the server will now automatically find it.
